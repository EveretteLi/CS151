Homework1
---------------------------
Calculator:
Operation and numbers must be typed in three separate command lines
Example:
add
2.56
2.18
---------------------------
RandomStringGenerator:
When adding the range, the "from" and "to" characters must follow the alphabetical order. Otherwise, IllegalArgumentException would be triggered.
Example:
RSG.addRange('d','Z');	//is valid
RSG.addRange('z','a');	//is not
Additional function reset() has been added to empty the current range.
---------------------------
DataAnalyzer/DataAnalyzerTester:
DataAnalyzer doesn't contain main function.
DataAnalyzerTester will generates a file called "dataFile.txt" to test DataAnalyzer.
To use this data file, user has to type in file name, "dataFile.txt", through terminal during the testing process.
To use other file for testing, user has to make sure that the file contains only 1 number each line.
For example:
1.34
2.56
3.348934
4.9490
5.2623
